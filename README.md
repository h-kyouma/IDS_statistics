<b>TODO</b>

- Cumulative distribution function:

    - https://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=53 (sth like that, but not only for normal distribution)

- Implementation of centers:

    - https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/statistics.php (sth like that on the left)

    - means:

        - arithmetic

        - harmonic

        - geometric

    - others:

        - mode

        - median



- Implementation of dispertion measures: Bartlomiej Jadwiszczak - I will take care of this chapter

    - https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/statistics.php (sth like that on the left)

    - classic methods:

        - variance

        - standard deviation

        - mean absolute deviation

    - positional methods:

        - interquartile range (IQR, midspread, H-spread)

    - dimensionless methods:

        - coefficient of variation



- Measures of (a)symmetry (dependent from previous task :-/ )

    - https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/skewness/default.aspx

    - Nonparametric skew

    - Standarized third central moment

    - Measure of flatness

    - Excess kurtosis



- Representative sample (difficult to find what can be done here):

    - Groupby in Pandas python can do it dataset.summarize() ???

    - possibility to group data by its features

    - show values describing data like std, var or avg of values



- Distributions (I can take of that Stanisław Zakrzewski)

    - https://www.statskingdom.com/distribution-calculator.html

    - Normal distribution calculator

    - T-Student distribution calculator

    - X^2 distribution calculator



- Testing of statistical hypotheses:

    - test for expected value (Bartłomiej Jabłoński - Maybe I will also cover the below tests if the selected topic is too trivial.)

    - minimal sample count

    - ???

    - Pearson X^2 test

    - Shapiro wilk test

    - Wald Wolfowits test



- Relationship betwen data

    - correlation (Barbara Morawska, as Bartłomiej Jabłoński, if that's not enough I'll take whole chapter.)

        - correlation table, X2 independence test

        - pearson linear correlation coefiicient

    - linear regression (Barbara Morawska, as Bartłomiej Jabłoński, if that's not enough I'll take whole chapter.)

    - t-student test

    - ANOVA



- Non parametric statistics (Jacek Wolski)

    - Sign Test

    - Wilcoxon test for observation pairs
